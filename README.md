##A decentralized note-taking application using Ethereum on the Goreli testnet.
## Introduction
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.
Noteit is a decentralized note-taking application built on the Ethereum blockchain, specifically on the Goreli testnet. It leverages React for the frontend and Ether.js to connect and interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
Try running some of the following tasks:


## Tech Stack

- **Blockchain (Backend)**: Ethereum on the Goreli testnet
- **Frontend**: React
- **Connection**: Ether.js

## Features

- **Create Notes**: Write and store notes on the decentralized Ethereum blockchain.
- **Read Notes**: Retrieve and view existing notes.

```shell
npx hardhat help
