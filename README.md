## Introduction(NoteIt: A Decentralized Note-Taking Application on the Goreli Testnet)


NoteIt is a decentralized note-taking application built on the Ethereum blockchain, specifically on the Goreli testnet. The project serves as a basic use case for Hardhat, featuring a sample contract, a corresponding test for that contract, and a deployment script.

It leverages React for the frontend and Ether.js to facilitate seamless connection and interaction with the Ethereum blockchain. NoteIt allows users to create and store notes in a decentralized manner, showcasing the potential of Ethereum on the Goreli testnet.
